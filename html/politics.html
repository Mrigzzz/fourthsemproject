<div class="bb">KASKI, Feb 17: Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) chair Kamal Thapa has described the amendment to the Media Council Bill and the Information Technology Bill before presenting them to the Parliament as a positive one.

In his address to a programme organised for the announcement of Media Nepal's central committee meeting and state committee in Pokhara today, he said both bills were against the constitutional norms and values as they were capable of hurting the sentiments of free press and an effort to revise the was obviously commendable.

Recalling the noticeable role of Nepali press in the establishment and restoration of democracy in the country and in nation's progress and economic development, the former minister insisted on allowing Nepali media run independently with dignity bearing in mind its role in further strengthening democracy.

As he said, Nepal media is facing three types of challenges: business, political and external pressure and influence. He took time to claim the party had realised its past mistakes and weaknesses and was aware of not repeating them, adding that the RPP's activities were centered on establishing the party as a' major party' in the future. Meanwhile, Surya Bastola has been elected the chair of a seven-member Gandaki state executive committee of Media Nepal.</div>
